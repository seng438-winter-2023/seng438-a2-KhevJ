# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

First, we had a meeting over Discord to setup Eclipse and all the external libraries. We then met together to discuss which of the methods of the Range class we would decide to do. Then, we divided the methods fairly for coding the JUnit Test after doing a detailed test plan. We will monitor each other's progress through Discord and we met on Thursday the 9th of February to review all test cases and their documentation.
