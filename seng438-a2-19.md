# 1 Introduction

For this lab assignment, we had to write JUnit and JMock tests for two different classes using the Black Box testing technique.  We wrote JUnit tests using two different methods: equivalent classes and boundary classes.  We mainly used boundary classes for testing the methods and equivalent classes when we tested DataUtilities. 

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

In order to conduct a proper testing plan, we will be utilizing the black box testing method. For the DataUtilities file, we will be testing all 5 of the methods and for the Range file, we will be choosing 5 out of the total 15 methods.  For the 5 methods to test Range we choose: getLength, contains, getLowerBound, getUpperBound, and intersects.  We decided to choose some of the getters in order to see if the boundary values are working.  When it comes to testing the chosen methods, we will create partitions that cover each general case of inputs.  For testing the methods of Range, all the getter methods only have one partition which covers if the returned value is correct or not.  How we approached contains is that we created a range from -1 to 1 which has three partitions.  The first partition is for values less than -1, the second partition is for values that are greater than or equal to -1 and less than or equal to 1 (within the range), and the third partition is for values greater than 1.  The last method we tested is intersects which has 6 partitions where we used the same range of -1 to 1.  The first partition is for ranges that are less than the specified range (-1 to 1) and that do not overlap with it, for example a range of -5 to -3.  The second partition is for ranges that are less than the specified range but overlap with part of the specified range, for example a range of -5 to 0. The third partition is for ranges that overlap completely with the specified range but also contains values that are bigger/smaller, for example a range of -2 to 2.  The fourth partition is for ranges within or equal to the specified range, for example -0.5 to 0 and -1 to 1.  The fifth partition is for ranges that are greater than but overlap with the specified range, for example a range of 0 to 5.  The sixth partition is for ranges that are strictly greater than the specified range, for example a range of 3 to 10.  Moving to DataUtilities, we have the methods: calculateColumnTotal, calculateRowTotal, createNumberArray, createNumberArray2D, and getCumulativePercentages.  For calculateColumnTotal and calculateRowTotal there are 5 partitions.  The first partition is for when a valid Values2D object and a valid row/column values is entered, for example a Values2D object that has one row and one column with 7.5 as the value a value of 0 for the row or column.  The second partition is for when the Values2D object has no rows and no columns in which case the method should print 0.  The third partition is for when a negative row/column index is used, for example -1.  The fourth partition is for when a row/column index is used that is greater than the last row/column, for example when an index of 3 is used for a table that has 2 rows and 2 columns.  The fifth partition is for when an invalid value (null) is in the Values2D object, for example a Values2D object that has one row and one column with null as the value.  For createNumberArray and createNumberArray2D there are 2 partitions.  The first partition is for when we create an array/2D array from another array/2D array that is valid (the array has a length of 0 or more and for a 2D array it has a row and column length of 0 or more), for example an array that is of length 2 or a 2D array that has 2 rows and 2 columns.  The second partition is for when we create an array that has invalid input (null), for example an array that has null as its only value or a 2D array of size 1 by 1 that has null for its value.  Finally, the method getCumulativePercentages has 2 partitions.  The first partition is when we calculate the cumulative percentage for an object of KeyedValues that contains valid input, for example an object of KeyedValues with 4, 2, 19.  The second partition is when there is invalid input in the KeyedValues object, for example a KeyedValues object that contains zero for every key or if there is a null value.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The team managed to complete the assignment successfully by working with a mixture of online and in person meetings. We began developing our test design plan together to inquire everyone in the group’s opinion on how we should approach our plan. First, we had a meeting over Discord to set up Eclipse and all the external libraries. We then met together to discuss which of the methods of the Range class we would decide to do. Then, we divided the methods fairly for coding the JUnit Test after doing a detailed test plan. We will monitor each other's progress through Discord and we met on Thursday the 9th of February to review all test cases and their documentation. 

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

When we first started the lab the first problem that we encountered was that everyone either had little experience with eclipse or had never used it before.  This made it difficult to get started on the lab because setting up the environment was hard to do.  Eventually, after recalling how to use eclipse and making some mistakes, we were able to get everyone to a point where they understood how to use eclipse.  Another challenge we came across was JMock testing.  We were all confused on how to set up and use JMock, as well as why JMock is beneficial to use instead of using JUnit.  Luckily, one of our group members quickly understood how to use and write effective JMock tests and explained it to the other group members.


# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab was pretty well structured. However, we felt that more info on how to use JMock were needed.
